# Dozone ðŸ§ 

A minimal, beautifully designed productivity app built with **Tauri + React + TypeScript + Rust**.

Dozone lets you organize tasks across multiple boards and sections (like `Backlog`, `Today`, `Done`, etc.), with a special focus on distraction-free flow modes:
- ðŸ“‹ **Pamphlet View** â€“ A slim view focused only on todayâ€™s tasks
- ðŸŽ¯ **Focus Mode** â€“ A tiny floating window for just the current task

The app is built for local-first productivity, with support for JSON-based persistence and plans for future sync features.
